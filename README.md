# OOPs Assignment - 2

## Comparison of Person:

Class Person takes two parameters i.e. name, age of two people and then compares them.

## Implementation :

Firstly we check if the name parameter of both persons is equal. If yes, then we compare them according to age.
If name is not equal then we compare them based on name length and return true or false accordingly.
